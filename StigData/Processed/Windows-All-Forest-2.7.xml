      <rawString>1. Interview the IAO.

2. Obtain a copy of the siteâ€™s configuration management procedures documentation.

3. Verify that there is a local policy that requires changes to the directory schema to be processed through a configuration management process. This applies to directory schema changes whether implemented in a database or other types of files. For AD, this refers to changes to the AD schema.

4. If there is no policy that requires changes to the directory schema to be processed through a configuration management process, then this is a finding.

      <rawString>1. At the command line prompt enter (on a single line): 
dsquery * "cn=Directory Service,
cn=Windows NT,cn=Services,cn=Configuration,dc=[forest-name]" -scope base -attr * 

(Where dc=[forest-name] is the fully qualified LDAP name of the root of the domain being reviewed.)

Example:
The following is an example of the dsquery command for the vcfn.ost.com forest.

dsquery * "cn=Directory Service,cn=Windows  NT,cn=Services,cn=Configuration,  dc=vcfn,dc=ost,dc=com -scope base -attr * 

2. If the dsHeuristics attribute is listed, note the assigned value.

3. If the dsHeuristics attribute is defined and has a â€œ2â€ as the 7th character, then this is a finding.

Examples of values that would be a finding as follows:
 â€œ0000002â€, â€œ0010002â€, â€œ0000002000001â€.
(The 7th character controls anonymous access.)

Supplementary Notes:
Domain controllers have this option disabled by default. However, this check verifies that the option has not been enabled.

The dsHeuristics option can be configured with the Windows Support Tools Active Directory Service Interfaces Editor (ADSI Edit) console (adsiedit.msc).</rawString>

      <rawString>Start a Schema management console. (See supplemental notes.)
Select, then right-click on the Active Directory Schema entry in the left pane.
Select Permissions.

If any of the permissions for the Schema object are not at least as restrictive as those below, this is a finding. 

The permissions shown are at the summary level.  More detailed permissions can be viewed by selecting the Advanced button, selecting the desired entry, and the Edit button.

Authenticated Users:
Read
Special Permissions
The Special permissions for Authenticated Users are List and Read type.  If detailed permissions include any additional Permissions or Properties this is a finding.

Supplemental Notes:
If the Schema management console has not already been configured on the computer, create a console by using the following:

The steps for adding the snap-in may vary depending on the Windows version.
Register the required DLL module by typing the following at a command line "regsvr32 schmmgmt.dll".
Run "mmc.exe" to start a Microsoft Management Console. 
Select Add/Remove Snap-in from the File menu.
From the Available Standalone Snap-ins list, select Active Directory Schema
Select the Add button.
Select the OK button.

When done using the console, select Exit from the File (or Console) menu.
Select the No button to the Save console settingsâ€¦ prompt (unless the SA wishes to retain this console). If the console is retained, the recommended name is schmmgmt.msc and the recommended location is the [systemroot]\system32 directory.</rawString>

      <rawString>Open "Active Directory Users and Computers" on a domain controller in the forest root domain.

Navigate to the "Users" container.

Right-click on "Schema Admins" and select "Properties", and then select the "Members" tab.

If any accounts other than the built-in Administrators group are members, verify their necessity with the ISSO.

If any accounts are members of the group when schema changes are not being made, this is a finding.</rawString>

      <rawString>1. Use Registry Editor to navigate to the following: HLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpClient

2. If the value for â€œEnabledâ€ is not â€œ1â€, then this is a finding.

3. Use Registry Editor to navigate to the following: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters

4. If the value for â€œTypeâ€ is not â€œNTPâ€, then this is a finding.

Note:  If these checks indicate a finding because the NtpClient is not enabled, ask the SA to demonstrate that 
a) an alternate time synchronization tool is installed and  enabled and that 
b) a DoD-authorized external time source is being used.

5. If the Windows Time service is not enabled or no alternate tool is installed and enabled in its place, then this is a finding.</rawString>
